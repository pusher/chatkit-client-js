# Chatkit Retirement Announcement
We are sorry to say that as of April 23 2020, we will be fully retiring our
Chatkit product. We understand that this will be disappointing to customers who
have come to rely on the service, and are very sorry for the disruption that
this will cause for them. Our sales and customer support teams are available at
this time to handle enquiries and will support existing Chatkit customers as
far as they can with transition. All Chatkit billing has now ceased , and
customers will pay no more up to or beyond their usage for the remainder of the
service. You can read more about our decision to retire Chatkit here:
